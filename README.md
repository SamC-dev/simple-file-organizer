# Simple file organizer
The purpose of this work is to organize files efficiently.  

### How it works

There are 2 programs: **fileorganizer** and **addfile**. Running the first one all the files are moved in the correct subdirectories, depending on their type, if the subdirectories don't exist they are created. At the same time are printed out the file information (name, type and dimension), these are appended in a csv file, if this doesn't exist, it is automatically created. Finally it is built a table that summarize information of image files, like the rgba values.  

the second program works with CLI, when running the user can write the name of the file he wants to move.
